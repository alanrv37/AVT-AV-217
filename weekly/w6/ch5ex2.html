		<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
		<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide. In sous vide cooking, <dfn>you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to.</dfn> 
        <br>In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
		<p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us <i>before</i> <time datetime="2016-30-11">November 30.</time></p>
