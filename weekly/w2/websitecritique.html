	<h1>Bad sites</h1>
<h2>Blackboard </h2>- Layout is organized in a fashion that doesn’t seem to put more important things in a priority spot (courses, announcements).  There is the ability to reorganize the layout, and that is a good thing that it has the capability, but overall, there isn’t too much ease of use because a lot of the content doesn’t come with easy to understand tools.  It seems like there is a methodology to the site, from my understanding, since we also used blackboard in grade school and it was relatively the same, just repurposed for GMU. However, it does not have a hidden beauty or, even regular beauty really, in this iteration. 

<h2>Amctheaters.com</h2> - this site always has functionality issues.  From slow loading times to downright errors in check out, it always seems to come with problems.  It does have some well organized content, and the information is enough and relayed in a way that lets the viewer understand what is happening.  The site could also use a touch more of simplicity - it is way too content heavy, which probably accounts for why it’s always lagging and malfunctioning. It also is way too content heavy, without providing too much engagement around other information available on the site. 

<h1>Good sites</h1>
<h2>Banfield.com</h2> - This site provides a great combination of efficiency in the use of space and the information layout.  It isn’t so text heavy and dependent on any, if not most parts of the site.  The layout guides the viewer around the site by continuing to let the viewer know that there is more information available.  The layout highlights significant information without having to put all the information available, making it easy to navigate around information that is being searched versus other.  Certain aspects, like the banner and tabs for specific pages, are simple yet effective in drawing the eye to them and helping the viewer understand what they’re looking at.  

<h2>Twitter.com</h2> - This site is amazing at organizing relevant information.  The dashboard provides a lot of information that you want based on who you follow and what posts relate to who you follow.  There isn’t many distractions that pull you in a direction you may not be interested.  The new organizing of the navigation makes it easy to understand where to go for specific pages or otherwise.  It seems as though the information would also be easily changed to fit other browsers based on the column use in the page. The form and color combination works seamlessly to provide a natural feel to the look of the page, and that draws more appeal to continued use of the site.
