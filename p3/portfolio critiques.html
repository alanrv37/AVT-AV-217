    <h1>UX Design Agency UK - https://ux-design.agency/</h1>
    <p>This website is very effective because of how minimalistic it is in terms of layout and color, and how it redirects the focus on the interactibility of the website, which is part of what they are advertising.  
    There are a couple transitions from one section to another, and through the coding it's done very seamlessly.  It doesn't appear like there isn't any information that isn't important/relevant to what they want to say.  
    There is also a good and obvious use of columns to organize information.  There are varying widths of rows that alternate between one piece of content and another without being all over the place.

    <h1>Martin Laxenaire https://www.martin-laxenaire.fr/ </h1>
    <p>This website has a very consistent color pallete that is strategically placed throughout the website, especially using animations.  The designer also uses it to highlight certain words across the page that helps to act as a guide as to where the viewer should go next or look for more information.
    Similarly to the previous example, there are mostly the use of 2 columns to spread the content, one caption accompanying a picture in this website.  
    One significant thing about this website, however, is that the designer explicitly shows an option to change the color of the page, making it more personable based on the user prefference.  This is succesful in making it a great website to show the capability of the designer.</p>
    <h1>Frances Comichelni https://www.francescomichelini.com/ </h1>
    <p>Oddly enough, this website uses the same color pallete of black/red/white for their website, and the contrast of the colors makes the content pop out a lot.  One very succesful technique of this page is that it spreads content all throughout the page in a way that is has direction.
    It also displays a lot of important information very big so that it would be hard to miss.  This is a smart technique because it makes sure that certain information is noticed and hopefully remembered by the viewer.  Their is also interesting animation of the picture of the designer, though I'm not 100% sure how succesful it is. '

    <h1>Fernando Mastrangelo https://fernandomastrangelo.com/ </h1>
    <p>This site uses a very clean and modernized layout, almost making the website look like a home or inside a building, which is very consistent with the kind of images that are used on the website. 
    There are also interesting things going on with the overlap of content boxes of text and the images; it doesn't seem awkward (for the most part), but it links to together the elements to show that one is there with the other, and they couldn't be as effective on their own. 
    The sizing of text is very proportional and seems to fill out the space most effectively, giving the snese of a lot of text even though there isn't necessarily a lot there. As with other sites, it has a lot of elements that can be interected with to link to another part of the website</p>
    <h1>Jamie Hunter https://www.jamiehunter.design/ </h1>
    <p>This websites uses a significant amount of animation to illustrate the work be the designer and what their focuses are.  As stated at the begining of the website, the designer is using a different layout, it's done by scrolling through the page, though it seems like your actually just flipping through the different animations on the page rather than scrolling down the page.
    There is a very small color pallete again, consisting of mostly black/white/flat colors.  The different colors are part of the organization which is effective in showing what part you are on.  This will help to guide the viewer throughout the page.  
    There is also a lot of large text that helps to catch the attention of the viewer, which helps understand each section a little better. </p>
